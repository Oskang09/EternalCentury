# Discontinued Project

# Thing were build 

1. Using [Exposed](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed) as ORM connecting with PostgreSQL.
2. Adding custom enum, json, list, minecraft serializable type.
3. Using [Javalin](https://javalin.io/) to expose API and build out a simple structure to dynamically load and generic response.
4. Extending the built in enchantment from minecraft and customize own enchantment with more playable game logic
5. Extending [UI Library](https://github.com/ReactantDev) to be more structural and dynamically loaded
6. Integrated [Revenue Monster](https://revenuemonster.my/) to provide payment options when in-game
7. Listening most of players event to customize their original logic
8. Building points API which can support multiple points at once
9. Building title API which can dynamically added and provide interface to build condition and some lifecycle function
10. Extending original mob entity api to custom their drops & loots
